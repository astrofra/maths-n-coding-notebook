# parse a BVH (biovision mocap file) and prints the position of the head

**Let's implement a program in Python that can parse a BVH (biovision mocap file) and prints the position of the head of the human character, frame by frame, in the console.
The position needs to be in 3D.**

To implement a program that can parse a BVH file and print the position of the head of the human character, you can use the bvh library. First, you'll need to install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install bvh
```

Now, you can create a Python script to parse the BVH file and output the head position for each frame. Here's a basic implementation:

```python
import sys
import numpy as np
from bvh import Bvh

def load_bvh(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        mocap_data = file.read()
    return Bvh(mocap_data)

def get_head_position(bvh_data, frame_number):
    frame_data = bvh_data.frames[frame_number]
    head_joint = bvh_data.joint('Head')  # You may need to adjust this depending on the specific naming in your BVH file

    # Get the head joint's global position
    position = bvh_data.frames_joint_channel(frame_number, head_joint, channels=['Xposition', 'Yposition', 'Zposition'])

    return np.array(position, dtype=float)

def main(file_path):
    bvh_data = load_bvh(file_path)

    num_frames = len(bvh_data.frames)
    for frame_number in range(num_frames):
        head_position = get_head_position(bvh_data, frame_number)
        print(f'Frame {frame_number + 1}: Head position = {head_position}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print('Usage: python bvh_head_position.py <BVH_FILE_PATH>')
        sys.exit(1)

    main(sys.argv[1])
```

To run the script, use the following command, replacing <BVH_FILE_PATH> with the path to your BVH file:

```bash
python bvh_head_position.py <BVH_FILE_PATH>
```

This script will print the head position for each frame in the console.

> Note: The joint name 'Head' might differ in your specific BVH file. You can replace it with the appropriate name or adjust the script to search for the head joint using a different method.
